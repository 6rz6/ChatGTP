Python Terminal which can execute code in chatgtp:
--------------------------------------------------------
`can you run the following code in a python terminal simulation?
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape(URL):
response = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
return soup.text

Call the scrape function with the URL "https://gym1.shop/"

result = scrape("https://gym1.shop/")

Print the result

print(result)
`
--------------------------------------------------------
`
Sure, I can run the code in a simulated Python terminal. Here's how it might look:

Python 3.9.5 (default, May  4 2021, 03:36:27)
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>


Now let's copy and paste the code into the terminal and execute it:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape(URL):
    response = requests.get(URL)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    return soup.text

# Call the scrape function with the URL "https://gym1.shop/"
result = scrape("https://gym1.shop/")

# Print the result
print(result)


And here's what the output would look like:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>gym1</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
