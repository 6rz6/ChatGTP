Introduction
************

   Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating
system.  The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on
Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell
sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

   Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from
the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh.  It is intended to be a conformant
implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working
Group 1003.2).
